RFID-enabled Baskets: The system includes specially designed shopping baskets that are embedded with RFID tags. These tags can store and transmit data wirelessly.

RFID Readers: RFID readers are strategically placed at various points in the retail store, such as at entrances, exits, and near checkout counters. These readers can communicate with the RFID tags on the baskets and capture the data stored in them.

Automated Item Tracking: As customers shop, the RFID tags on the baskets automatically track the items they place in the basket. The RFID readers capture this data in real-time, creating a digital record of the items in each basket.

Seamless Checkout: When customers are ready to check out, they can simply proceed to the checkout counter. The RFID reader at the checkout counter can quickly scan the RFID tags on the baskets, automatically retrieving the item data and generating a detailed bill for the customer.

Inventory Management: The system also provides retailers with real-time visibility into their inventory levels. As items are added or removed from the baskets, the inventory system is automatically updated, allowing retailers to track stock levels and replenish inventory more efficiently.

Enhanced Customer Experience: The smart basket retail system with RFID modules offers a seamless and convenient shopping experience for customers. It eliminates the need for manual item scanning at checkout, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

Loss Prevention: The RFID technology in the system also helps with loss prevention by providing real-time alerts when items are removed from the store without being paid for, helping to prevent theft and reduce shrinkage.

We also made a decision tree ML model for the same which when an item is scanned it gets deducted from the shops inventory,after which it goes below a certain threashold it will alert the owner and thus help the owner keep track of all the items in the shop
